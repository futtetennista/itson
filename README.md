# It's On

Simple backend written in [Haskell](haskell.org) and frontend written in [Elm](elm-lang.org) to search for music using API provided by different online services.

My goal with this pet project is to get a feeling of what is like to develop a real-world application using only functional programming languages and getting some experience in using Haskell and Elm.
